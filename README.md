# ImageShare
ImageShare is a web-based image sharing tool. It's intended to be used with game consoles like the Nintendo 3DS, but it should work on anything with a semi-modern web browser (JavaScript support is not required).

ImageShare uploads photos to [Imgbb.com](http://imgbb.com) and presents the URL as a QR code. This allows the image to be easily transfered to any device with the ability to scan QR codes. The camera apps on most iOS and Android devices can read QR codes, so you might not even need to install a separate app.

Images uploaded using ImageShare are subject to Imgbb's [Terms of Service](https://imgbb.com/tos) and [Privacy Policy](https://imgbb.com/privacy), and are deleted automatically after five minutes.

**Officially supported devices:**
 * Nintendo 3DS/2DS
