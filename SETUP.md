# ImageShare Settings

ImageShare uses anonymous image uploads by default, which may expire or have other limitations. You can enter your own API key as a user to enable more upload options and features.

## ImgBB API

Uploading an image with an ImgBB API key will save it to your own ImgBB account, which can be accessed on another device through the ImgBB website without scanning the QR code. The image also won't expire automatically, like anonymous ImgBB uploads.

Here's how to enable ImgBB API uploads:

1. You need an ImgBB account. [Create a free account](https://imgbb.com/signup), or [log in](https://imgbb.com/login) if you already have one.
2. Go to the [ImgBB API page](https://api.imgbb.com/) and create an API key.
3. On your device with ImageShare, open the settings page and enter the new API key into the text.
4. Click the Save button on the settings page.
5. Make sure the "ImgBB with API key" option is selected when uploading an image.

The API key is saved in the browser cookies on your device for one year. You can delete it by clearing the text field and saving the settings again.
